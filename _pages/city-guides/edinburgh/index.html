    place: The Milkman
    title: it’s a wonderful mix of old Edinburgh and contemporary cool
    description: Coffee time. Start your day at The Milkman; it’s a wonderful mix of old Edinburgh and contemporary cool. Even the shopfront mixes the original, worn, hand-drawn lettering of some old forgotten confectioners with its own minimalist signage. The trend continues inside; original features are complemented and enhanced by smart, modern touches – but we’re here for more than just a cool interior. The Milkman serves up some of the finest coffee in the city – and the pastries are delicious.

    place: National Museum
    title: a work of art in itself
    description: Scotland’s National Museum is another example of heritage meeting modernity; the grand Victorian wing is intact, with its showstopper exhibition hall – a work of art in itself – the focal point for exploring the many galleries. Yet the far end is bookended with the golden-hued, post-modern new building. Between each you’ll find dinosaurs and mummies, decorative arts from across the world and more – but the star for this rundown are the impressive design, art and fashion galleries, boasting an extraordinary collection to satisfy your design cravings.

    place: Summerhall
    title: A cultural pit-stop like no other
    description: Edinburgh’s arts scene is nothing short of eclectic, dynamic and electric; to catch a flavour of its unique personality, head for Summerhall. This cultural centre is home to a revolving door of experimental and thought-provoking performances, alongside captivating exhibitions. Also, the bar, cafe and gift shop are great, making this a cultural pit-stop like no other...

    place: Dovecot
    title: An airy gallery that was once a Victorian swimming pool
    description: Another impressive space-reinvention, this fine-art tapestry studio inhabits an airy gallery that was once a Victorian swimming pool. You can watch the weavers at work, crafting away at the forefront of a rather old Edinburgh craft heritage. The best view is from above, in the viewing gallery, with an assortment of stylish gifts to be nabbed in the gift shop. It would be a sin not to kill some time in the cafe here – one of the best in Edinburgh, no less.

    place: Custom Lane
    title: Set in an old quayside warehouse, Custom Lane is now a hub for creatives
    description: In the picturesque docks of Leith, amongst the trendy cafes and creative spaces that now typify this buzzing area, hides Custom Lane. Set in an old quayside warehouse, Custom Lane is now a hub for creatives, offering workshop spaces for all manner of local craftspeople. With its exhibition spaces, there’s always a selection of envelope-pushing exhibits or talks to check out. Or, visit the cafe and listen in on the creative hubbub before checking out some of the indie designers that regularly operate pop-up shops in the space.

    time: "18:53"
    place: Timberyard
    title: It’s an irresistable rustic setting for artisanal feasting
    description: Cast-iron pillars, exposed joists and whitewashed brickwork – Timberyard, true to its name, retains much of the industrial charm of its former life. It’s an irresistible rustic setting for artisanal feasting; the food here is sourced locally, from a network of foragers and suppliers that ensure each dishes’ creative composition is supported by delicious produce. The flavour combinations will surprise, reinventing classic Scottish ingredients with a flair that remains very popular.

    place: The Lucky Liquor Co.
    title: promising cocktails in a rainbow of bright colours
    description: Round off your Edinburgh adventure at The Lucky Liquor Co.; a loud neon sign outside is as good a signal as any, promising cocktails in a rainbow of bright colours. The interior is wonderfully minimalist, with the only discernible splashes of colour on display in generic, label-less glass bottles. A rotating menu of 13 cocktails allows the bartenders to push their creativity; some will be set on fire, others served in a lightbulb, and some mixed with ice cream – but there is substance behind the more showy elements. The menu constantly demands the best of its creators and the drinks reflect that. A fine finish, for sure.
